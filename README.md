# What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed in the late 80s by Francesco Cirillo. The theory behind this technique is that taking frequent breaks can help improve your mental focus and prevent burnout. It can improve mental agility, boost motivation, and provide a better sense of accomplishment by breaking tasks into smaller chunks. For these reasons, this technique is quite popular with programmers.

The idea is to break down work into short intervals, usually 25 minutes, with short breaks in between sessions, usually 5 to 10 minutes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, Italian word for tomato. The goal is to use each Pomodoro to focus on one specific task, then take a break before starting the next one.
